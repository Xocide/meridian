Meridian
========

Meridian is a PHP framework that runs on PHP and MySQL (if you want to use a database).

Requirements
------------

Meridian requires PHP and if you want to use the database, MySQL.

While designed to run on a server with mod_rewrite or equivalent
it's quite possible it might run without it.
